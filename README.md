# THE FORBIDDEN NEOVIM CONFIG ðŸ’€

Yeah, a one-file Neovim config is coolâ€¦ but you know whatâ€™s cooler? A **one-line Neovim config**. No newlines. No indentation. Just a single, deranged Lua incantation that sets options, binds keys, loads plugins, manages autocommands, and even fits an ASCII logo right in there. It loads so fast your terminal physically recoils.

One line that bends reality, optimizes everything, and makes your keyboard fear your speed. One line that boots in **milliseconds**, auto-tunes your workflow, and makes Vim itself weep in jealousy. It defies programming principles, spits in the face of maintainability, and laughs at readability yet it works flawlessly. Others spend months tweaking their configs, I write **one** line and ascend to pure editing enlightenment.

And just when you think it couldnâ€™t get crazier, I seal it perfectly frozen in time. Now itâ€™s immutable, untouchable, and eternal. No more tweaking. No more endless configuration. Just **one line, one file, perfection**.

Some call it unreadable, I call it **perfection**.<br>
PS: There might have been a bit of satire in it :)
